**`Self-taught & Passionationate IT, Cybersecurity, & Linux Professional`**

---

I am a self-taught IT & infosec professional. All projects and repositories are built through countless hours of pouring over books and websites, trying to learn as much as I can, and become a small, better, part of the bigger world of information technologies and information security. I am currently working on getting my foot in the door of IT, in general. I have my CompTIA A+ and Security+ certifications, with my Network+ exam booked for the end of September 2023. While working on that, I am polishing my Bash skills and further learning Python. After I have acheived my CompTIA trifecta, I plan to work towards more operating system specific certifications in both Microsoft and Linux. And then my long journey of lifelong cybersecurity learning.
